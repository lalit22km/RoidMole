Any type of contribution is welcome and appreciated. You can contribute by reporting errors, writing device specific scripts and improving the codebase.

I am still writing the base program. I will try to make it as modular as possible. The device specific scripts will be drop-in. Placing a script in the correct directory with proper functions should work properly without modifying the codebase.
